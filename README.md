A 3D printed modification for ContactGlove+Magnetra.

You will need:
12 M3x3 threaded inserts
12 M3*8 screws
6mm elastic band

The elastic bands hold the assembly steady by straping to the wrist and the palm. The bands mostly only require a one-time length adjustment and you don't need to loosen them for wearing the glove.
